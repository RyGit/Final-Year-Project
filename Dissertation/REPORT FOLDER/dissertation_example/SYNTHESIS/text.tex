\chapter{Some Design and Implementation Stuff}\label{device}

\section{Introduction}
There will probably be more than one chapter of synthesis. None of
which will be called `Synthesis'. This is the chapter where the
reader is introduced to the design and/or implementation in a software
development project. Your project may not fit this description and so
you may not have a chapter like this.

Clearly, Tab.~\ref{device:table} provides a thoughtful summary of a
large amount of information.
